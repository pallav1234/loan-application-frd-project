# Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM)

**Project:** Online Loan Application System  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD  
**Author:** Pallav Daru  

---

## Purpose
The RTM ensures that every **business requirement (BRD)** is traced to its corresponding **functional requirements (FRD)**, **user stories**, **screen specifications**, and can later be linked to **test cases**. This guarantees full coverage and reduces the risk of missing requirements.
